# Reinforcement Learning Agents on Rule Discovery
Pavan Pandurangi, William Shi, Jason Wang

## Setup

Clone the repository.

```shell
conda create --name rl-mao
conda activate rl-mao
conda install python=3.9
pip install pettingzoo
```

## Project Description

How quickly are standard reinforcement learning algorithms able to learn
newly added rules to the game of Mao? How does the complexity of the base game and the complexity
of the added rule impact the rate of rule discovery?
